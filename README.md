# Analysis-on-earthquakes
This is a small project to show the various earthquakes which have happened in the past.
 
Basically this project uses the languages HTML,CSS and PHP. The front end was designed with the help of HTML and the backend was designed using PHP.
Add the eixisting files to the www folder in Wamp server( or any other file for your server). Connect the database in the server and the codes provided.

Don't run the code directly as it won't work because of local server being used. Make your own database with the given column names and then it will automatically work.
